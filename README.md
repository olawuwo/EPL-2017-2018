# SQL-Practice_EPL-2017-2018

In this project, I have used the EPL 2017/2018 season data to practice my SQL skills. I've used PowerQuery to clean the [raw data](Source_data/2017:2018-epl_matches_raw.csv) such as the date, full-time and halftime scores. I then import the cleaned csv data to PostGreSQL to run my queries. 

You can refer to the 2017-18 EPL page on Wikipedia for more information.
