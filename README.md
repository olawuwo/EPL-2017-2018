# SQL-Practice_EPL-2017-2018

In this project, I used SQL proficiency on the dataset from the English Premier League (EPL) 2017/2018 season to anwser some questions stated below. I've used PowerQuery to clean the [raw data](Source_data/2017:2018-epl_matches_raw.csv) provide the CSV file. I cleaned up the dates, full-time and halftime scores. 

I proceeded to import the [cleaned CSV data}(Source_data/2017:2018-epl_matches_cleaned.csv) into a PostGreSQL database so as to execute my SQL queries and extract anwsers to the questions. I have also included the [Schema database sql file](Source_data/epl_matches_2017:2018.sql) in the Source data folder. Simply import the file and you're good to go. 
 
More information about the 2017-18 EPL is available on the  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017%E2%80%9318_Premier_League) page. Thanks.
